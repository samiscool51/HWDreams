# Highway Dreams
Marina and Amber go to a pawn shop and buy some strange device. Amber regrets it.
## Installation and Prerequisites
The mod requires two things:
1. [Archer's Highway Blossoms Customs Loader](https://github.com/archerassassin8/highway-blossoms-customs-loader)
2. The Highway Blossoms Next Exit DLC.

once both requirements are met, installation of the mod is as follows:
- download the mod's zip folder from the [releases](test) and unzip it somewhere (such as your desktop or downloads)
- drag the FOLDER (not zip) of the mod to $Game_location/Highway Blossoms/game/mods\
  (on steam right clicking the game then selecting the "Manage" option then clicking on the "Browse Local Files" will open the game directory. itch.io users are on their own.)
- done. enjoy whatever is left.

## Oh dear, it's story time. spoilers ahead.
The Unfinished mod that i started many moons ago but am unable to finish. Originally starting as some really bad fan fiction it soon blossomed into a mod... with really bad fan fiction as it's script.\
my ideas were quite ambitious, i had hoped to use SFM for dell and glados but other things within my life had to take priority.\
so i'm releasing the mod even though it's in a unfinished state. better to release it now then never.\
the mod is under the GPL v3 licence, so if you wish, you can finish it with your own interpretation of whatever needs to be added, go ahead.\
i'd love to see other's interpretations of what i wrote so i encourage you.\
go explore the extra's and resources folder for some inspiration. the extras folder where i stored the raw assets and other things i needed to keep track of. and the resources folder is finished or temporary assets.\
and yes i used ChatGPT. mainly to help write characters more in line with how they talk. it didn't write any part of the script hand on heart.
